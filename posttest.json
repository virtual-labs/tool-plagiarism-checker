            "question": "1. A positive edge-triggered D flip-flop is connected to a positive edge-triggered J K flip-flop. The Q output of the D flip-flop is connected to both the J and K inputs of the J K flip-flop, while the Q output of the J K flip-flop is connected to the input of the D flip-flop. At first, the output of a D flip-flop is set to logic one, and the output of the JK flip-flop is cleared. Which one of the following options is the bit sequence generated at the Q output of the JK flip-flop when the flip-flops are connected to a free-running standard clock? Consider that J = K = 1 is the toggle mode and J = K = 0 is the state-holding mode of the JK flip-flop. Both the flip-flops have non-zero propagation delays.",
