<p>The counters will be assembled using two 74LS73 dual J-K flip-flop chips and a 74LS02 quad NOR chip.</p><p>This enables one to reset any of the flip-flops by making Râ = 0 irrespective of the status of the clock (CK) input.</p><p>The asynchronous Râ input will be utilised in this experiment to initialise the flip-flop outputs as well as to obtain counters having cycle length N less than 16.</p><p>   Pin connections:   Basic Counter (Binary Ripple Counter)   1..</p><p>Make J = K = 1 for all the flip-flops, thereby converting the J-K flip-flops to T flip-flops.</p><p>Connect all Râ inputs together to an Input Switch, and the outputs Q0,Q1,Q2,Q3 to four LED Displays. 2.</p><p>Set up an Up-counting Binary Ripple Counter by making clock connections as follows: CK0 = Manual Clock (CLK-M), CK1 = Q0, CK2 = Q1, CK3 = Q2. 3.</p><p>Using the Input Switch connected to the common Râ input, initialise the counter to the start 4.</p><p>Apply Manual Clock pulses and tabulate the state sequence for the entire cycle. 5.</p><p>Now change the clock input connections to CK1 = Q0’, CK2 = Q1’, CK3 = Q2’, to obtain a Down-counting Binary Ripple counter.</p><p>Asynchronous (ripple) counter: An asynchronous (ripple) counter is a single JK-type flip-flop, with its J (data) input fed from its own inverted output.</p><p>If this output is then used as the clock signal for a similarly arranged D flip-flop (remember to invert the output to the input), you will get another 1 bit counter that counts half as fast.</p><p>Putting them together yields a two-bit counter: Cycle Q1 Q2 (Q1:Q0)dec 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 2 1 0 2 3 1 1 3 4 0 0 0 Synchronous counter: A simple way of implementing the logic for each bit of an ascending counter is for each bit to toggle when all of the less significant bits are at a logic high state.</p><p>A decade counter may have each digit binary encoded (that is, it may count in binary-coded decimal, as the 7490 integrated circuit did) or other binary encodings (such as the bi-quinary encoding of the 7490 integrated circuit).</p><p>The latter type of circuit finds applications in multiplexers and demultiplexers, or wherever a scanning type of behavior is useful.</p><p>A decade counter has the count sequence 0 → 1 → 2 →.....→ 8 → 9 → 0..</p><p>, which can be achieved by making Râ = (Q3 â¢Q1)â for all the flip-flops in a 4-bit binary counter.</p><p>This forces the counter to go to the state 0000 as soon as the counter makes the transition from the state 1001 representing count 9 to the next state 1010 according to the normal up counting sequence.</p><p>Decade synchronous counter The logic for the J-K inputs required for a Decade Synchronous Counter is as follows: J0 = K0 = 1; J1 = Q0â¢Q3â, K1 = Q0; J2 = K2 = Q0â¢Q1; J3 = Q0â¢Q1â¢Q2, K3 = Q0.</p><p>Ring Counter The main difference between a ring counter and a shift register is that in a ring counter, the output of the last flip-flop is connected to the input of the first flip-flop, but in a shift resister, it is taken as output.</p><p>ORI is coupled to Preset (PR) in FF-1 and Clear (CLR) in FF-2 and FF-3 for a 3 bit ring counter.</p><p>As a result, output Q = 1 is generated at FF-1, whereas output Q = 0 is generated by the rest of the flip-flops.</p><p>Pre-set 1 is the output Q = 1 at FF-1 that is utilised to create the ring counter.</p><p>Preset 1 is created by setting ORI to zero and setting the time Clock (CLK) to don&#039;t care.</p><p>After that, the ORI was set to high and a low clock pulse signal was applied as the clock (CLK) was triggered on the negative edge.</p><p>Following that, the preset 1 is changed to the next flip-flop with each clock pulse, forming a Ring (hence the name Ring Counter) as illustrated in the table below: Cycle Q1 Q2 Q3 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 2 0 0 1 3 1 0 0 4 0 1 0 5 0 0 1 6 1 0 0 Multipurpose 4-bit Synchronous Counter CD4029 is a multipurpose 4-bit counter capable of operating in all the four combinations of Binary/BCD and Up/Down modes, depending on the values of the control inputs B/Dâ and U/Dâ.</p><p>In addition, the 4-bit output Q3Q2Q1Q0 of the counter can be preset to any value by applying the desired bits to the direct inputs D3D2D1D0 and making the Set Enable control SEN = 1.</p>
